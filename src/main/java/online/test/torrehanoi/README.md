# Hanoi Problem

Given a game board with three pegs and a set of disks of different diameter all stacked from smallest to largest on the leftmost peg, move all of the disks to the rightmost peg following these two rules. First, only one disk may be moved at a time. Second, a larger diameter disk may never be placed on a smaller disk. Any number of disks can be used.
