# Egg Dropping problem

Figure out the highest floor of a 100-floor building an egg can be dropped without breaking,  given two eggs.
You are to determine the minimum number of attempts required in the worst case scenario to find the critical floor.

Assumptions in the Egg Dropping Puzzle:

- The two eggs are identical.
- If an egg does not break by dropping from a certain floor, it will not break dropping from any floor below that.
- If an egg breaks by dropping on a certain floor, it will break dropping from any floor above that.
- An egg may break by dropping on the 1st floor.
- An egg may not break by dropping even on the 100th floor.
